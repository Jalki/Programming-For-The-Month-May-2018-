#Python Population Generator

This is a simple project that shows how to do data visualization in python. It takes in player input for the Initial population, Population growth, Death Rate, and Land Area to produce a simulation of real world population models. Calculating per year (turn), You can gain positive, negative, or nuetral growth depending on your inputs from earlier.

Initial 1.0 Version brought the concept to life with exponentially increase population

2.0 brings Death Rate and Land Area functionality along with python's Mathplotlib to accurately plot the points for the user

3.0 is final version that allows the player to connect to a google spreadsheet to record your stats

A discord bot using these functionality or more may come in the future! Stay tuned!
