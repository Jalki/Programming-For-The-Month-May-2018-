#Python Population Generator

This is a simple project that shows how to do data visualization in python. It takes in player input for the Initial population, Population growth, Death Rate, and Land Area to produce a simulation of real world population models. Calculating per year (turn), You can gain positive, negative, or nuetral growth depending on your inputs from earlier.

Initial 1.0 Version brought the concept to life with exponentially increase population. Simple setup.

2.0 brings Death Rate and Land Area functionality along with python's Mathplotlib to accurately plot the points for the user. This will also use calculus to actively so the net gain of the population (Derivatives!).
